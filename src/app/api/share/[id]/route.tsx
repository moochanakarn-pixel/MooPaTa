// Generates a story-ratio (1080x1920) share card PNG for one activity —
// distance, pace/speed, time, heart rate, and a route sketch — for the user
// to save and post to Instagram/Facebook/Line stories themselves. There's no
// direct "post to story" here: that needs a reviewed Meta/Instagram business
// app integration, well beyond a personal project's scope.
//
// ?bg=transparent drops the gradient background entirely (next/og's PNG
// output supports alpha natively — nothing extra needed) so the card can be
// dropped onto an Instagram/Line story over a photo instead of always
// carrying its own backdrop, mirroring what Strava's own share sheet offers.
//
// ?style=hero switches from the default "grid" layout (full stat grid +
// route sketch, left-aligned) to a minimal, centered card with just the hero
// number and at most two supporting stats — no grid, no route. Two very
// different use cases: grid for a detailed record of the activity, hero for
// a quick centered flex that reads at a glance (closer to what most people
// actually post to a story).
//
// ?pos=top|center|bottom picks where the whole details block (logo, badges,
// name, hero number, sub-stats/route, stat grid) sits vertically in the
// frame — as one group, not the logo/header separately pinned to the top
// and a stat grid separately pinned to the bottom like before. Combined
// with ?bg=transparent this is what makes the card usable as an
// Instagram/Line-story sticker: pick top or bottom to leave the rest of the
// frame free for the photo underneath to show through. Defaults to
// "center". The logo used to stay pinned top-left regardless of ?pos (on
// the theory that it's just a small brand mark, not part of "the
// details") — changed after user feedback that a centered/bottom-anchored
// card left the logo stranded alone at the top with a large empty gap
// before the rest of the content; it now moves as part of the same group.

  // read as a solid backing. Four tight, barely-blurred offsets in each
  // diagonal direction (a poor-man's text-stroke — satori has no
